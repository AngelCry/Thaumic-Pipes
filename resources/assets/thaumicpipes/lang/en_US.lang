tc.research_text.thaumicPipe=Never said suction was bad, just that it's not good...
tp.research_page.thaumicPipe.1=You thought that the previous essentia transport systems you developed were great for small to medium scale alchemical contraptions, but lacked the ability to transfer large amounts of essentia at any given time.<BR>With that in mind, using the secrets of the ender realm and essentia rich filters, you have devised a way to transport essentia with improved effectiveness and speed.<BR>These pipes suck up all nearby essentia from sources such as the alembic, and push it down the line.<BR>Without the suction system, you think that automation would be a breeze.
tp.research_page.thaumicPipe.2=These pipes can transfer more than one type of essentia at a time, and there is no limit to how much it can transfer each time.<BR>They will deposit all of their essentia into the closest jar. For greater control, labelled jars still reject all essentia pushed towards them, so it's recommended that if you want full automation, using labels will go a long way.<BR>Clicking on the pipes with an empty hand will inform you how much is in it, and shift right clicking it drains it of all essentia.
tp.research_page.thaumicPipe.3=Right clicking on the pipe with a wand will set a "priority" direction, sending all leftover essentia down that direction.
